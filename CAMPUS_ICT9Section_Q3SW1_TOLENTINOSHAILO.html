            <h2>What is Alice in Borderland?</h2>
            <p>Alice in Borderland takes place in modern-day Tokyo after an unexplained event wipes out most of this major city. The survivors who are left are given visas to stay in this new realm, known as Borderland. When their visas expire, they’re shot on sight by a laser. The only way to extend a visa and keep living is to compete in a series of games. Each game has been assigned a different card. The suit of each refers to the type of game — Spades are strength, Clubs are team battles, Diamonds are battles of wits, and Hearts are games of betrayal — and the number refers to the level of difficulty. It’s a simple system for a really messed up concept.</p>
